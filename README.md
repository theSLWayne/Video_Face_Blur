First, clone this repository to the computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/theSLWayne/Video_Face_Blur.git
```

Then, create a Python virtual environment.

```
python -m venv facial_blur
```

Activate the created virtual environment.

- For linux:
    ```
    source facial_blur/bin/activate
    ```

- For Windows:
    ```
    facial_blur\Source\activate
    ```

Install dependencies to the virtual environment.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After everything is installed, all scripts of the repository can be run inside the virtual environment.

In order to deactivate the virtual environment, simply use `deactivate` command.
